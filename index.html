        <span class="title-project">About Me (2004)</span>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">During my early teenage years, I enjoyed exploring new activities such as dancing, skating,
          disassembling and reassembling toys, and playing games. Over time, I realized game development offered numerous 
          opportunities for learning and growth, which ultimately sparked my interest in the field.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">I later joined a company called Marquee where I created several games. Though
          I initially lacked teamwork experience, I began collaborating with others to build exciting projects.
          Through this process, I learned the importance of compromise and gained valuable skills from colleagues.
          I'm always open to connecting with people, so feel free to contact me anytime.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">While I didn't prioritize formal college education,
          I acquired foundational knowledge of Unity Game Development and later joined Outscal to study essential 
          topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), programming patterns, and system design. This learning 
          journey equipped me with self-directed education skills, enabling me to independently master new concepts 
          through online resources and personal study.</p>
